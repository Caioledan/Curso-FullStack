<h2>My 3 favorite movies that I watched in the past weeks</h2>

<hr>

<h3>10 Things that I hate about you</h3>

<p>That was an amazing movie that I watched with my girlfrien, and we loved it. Heath Ledger did a really nice job acting in this movie.</p>

<h3>La sociedade de la nieve</h3>

<p>That movie made me think a lot, about hard times. The 571 accident was terrible, and the people that was there suffered a lot. I can't even imagine how is to go through that.</p>

<h3>Nobody</h3>

<p>A movie like Jhon Wick. It was nice to watch, but there is a lot of brutal scenes. It's a movie to watch with nothing in mind, just to spend some time.</p>
